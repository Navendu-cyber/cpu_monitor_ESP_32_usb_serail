# cpu_monitor_ESP_32_usb_serail
This project turns an ESP32 into a real-time PC hardware monitor with a 1.8" TFT display, a physical servo needle, and a WS2812 LED strip that reacts to live system load. All CPU/RAM/Temperature data is streamed from the PC to the ESP32 through a lightweight Python script over USB serial.
